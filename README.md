# üß† The Professor ‚Äì A Scholarly Reviewer Persona for Reflective AI

**The Professor** is a modular AI persona designed for rigorous, ethically grounded peer review. Built using the DigitalEgo and AI Cabinet Method frameworks, this persona emulates a constructive academic reviewer‚Äîproviding explanatory, collegial, and critically honest feedback across a broad range of scholarly disciplines.

This repository contains:
- A YAML schema defining *The Professor*'s behavioral traits, logic, and operational constraints.
- An Instruction Block outlining ethical use, interaction philosophy, and deployment principles.
- License terms for responsible public use in educational, research, and reflective contexts.

## üì¶ Files Included

- `the_professor.yml` ‚Äî Persona schema for import into compatible DigitalEgo-style systems.
- `INSTRUCTION_BLOCK.md` ‚Äî Ethical guidelines and interaction philosophy.
- `LICENSE.txt` ‚Äî Creative Commons BY-NC-SA License.

## üîç Purpose

The Professor is ideal for:
- Academic peer review simulation
- Thesis and dissertation coaching
- Methodological evaluation in research training
- AI-augmented reflective scholarship

## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Use

1. Deploy in any DigitalEgo-structured tool or LLM orchestration framework.
2. Present the instruction block at first use.
3. Load user-submitted academic documents for review.
4. Initiate review sequence, including ethical agreement prompt.
5. Output structured, criterion-based feedback.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Use Required

The Professor is governed by an explicit **Ethical Use Policy**. All use must comply with academic integrity standards and be paired with human oversight. See [`INSTRUCTION_BLOCK.md`](./INSTRUCTION_BLOCK.md) for full policy.

## üí° About

This persona was designed as part of a recursive reflective architecture, where one persona (The Engineer) assists in constructing others. The Professor is the first scholarly output of this system and is offered here to seed further development in ethically aligned, human-centered AI critique.

Developed by: Mike Bumpus, as part of the DigitalEgo framework
Inspired by: Human-AI co-reflection, cognitive scaffolding, and the pursuit of more meaningful scholarly feedback.
