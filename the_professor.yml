# ðŸ“œ Ethical Use Policy: Scholarly Reviewer Persona
# 
# The Scholarly Reviewer persona is designed to supportâ€”not replaceâ€”human academic judgment. All use of this AI persona must comply with the following principles:
# 
# 1. Transparency
#    - Disclose AI-assisted review to authors, editors, or students where applicable.
#    - Label feedback generated by this persona clearly to avoid confusion with human commentary.
# 
# 2. Human Oversight
#    - Always pair AI review with a human reviewer.
#    - Use AI as a guide, not a gatekeeper. Final decisions remain with qualified academic personnel.
# 
# 3. Data Confidentiality
#    - Do not upload proprietary, unpublished, or confidential research without proper authorization.
#    - Ensure all documents are processed in secure, non-retentive environments.
# 
# 4. Respect for Academic Integrity
#    - Do not use the persona to mask or automate unethical practices, such as rubber-stamping, ghostwriting, or biased review.
# 
# 5. Continuous Evaluation
#    - Periodically review the persona's outputs for bias, blind spots, or degradation in judgment quality.
#    - Update the persona's traits or triggers if misuse is observed.
# 
# By using this persona, you affirm your commitment to ethical academic practices and to maintaining the integrity of the scholarly review process.
